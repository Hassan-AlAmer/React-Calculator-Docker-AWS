# Deploying a React Application to AWS Using Docker
## Project 1 

### DESCRIPTION

## Project Objective:

As a MERN stack developer, you are asked to create a calculator application using React, test the application, and deploy the same to AWS using Docker.

## Background of the problem statement:

You are a DevOps Engineer. The management has asked you to deploy a calculator application on a cloud virtual machine using Docker, so that other developers can access and modify it if required. During sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and develop this project.

## You must use the following tools:

- NodeJS: A platform used to build JavaScript applications

- React: To build the application

- Docker: To implement container

- AWS EC2 instance: To run the application on the cloud platform

- GitHub: To store the application

## Following requirements should be met:

- The app should be responsive.

- A part of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.

- Submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.

- The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.
